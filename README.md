 # Packet Flow Visualizer Project

Welcome to the Packet Flow Visualizer project! This project provides hands-on experience in creating network topologies and analyzing packet flows. 

 # Objective:
- **Network Topology Creation:** Build a network layout using Cisco Packet Tracer based on college network information.
- **Packet Flow Investigation:** Capture and analyze packet headers to visualize data flow from your device to external networks.

 # Key Learning:
- Understand network design and architecture.
- Learn OSI model layers and metadata in packet headers.
- Differentiate between router (L3 device) and switch (L2 device) roles.

Join us to explore the intricacies of network dynamics and enhance your networking skills!
